# skinning-subdivision-surfaces
Research application aiming to optimize in real time the deformations of control points 
in order to obtain a smooth and intuitively animated subdivision surface.


## Installation
You need to install [QT](https://www.qt.io/) (>= 5.5).

You will also need an implementation of [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) (>= 3.0)

Please also install [eigen3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

Don't forget to build `libQGLViewer` in the extern directory.

## Usage

Press **s** to subdivide the mesh with the Loop subdivision.

Press **r** to redisplay the shape using the control points weights and the control points.

Press **b** to display the basic mesh.
